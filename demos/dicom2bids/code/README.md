# dicom2bids

Implementation of the
[Dcm2Bids tutorial](https://unfmontreal.github.io/Dcm2Bids/docs/2-tutorial/).

To run it all:

```
make clean
make all
```

Parameters are configured in the `config.sh`.

The content of the dcm2bids `config.json` was taken from
[Dcm2Bids tutorial](https://unfmontreal.github.io/Dcm2Bids/docs/2-tutorial/).

## issues

Some of the bold files seem to be missing from the [input repo](https://github.com/neurolabusc/dcm_qa_nih.git).

For example: `004_In_Axial_EPI-FMRI_(Interleaved_I_to_S)_20180918114023.nii.gz`.
