## Instructions

This repo contains 2 scripts to convert NIFTI files (output of dcm2niix) into BIDS compatible folder scaffold.

It's using mainly couple of functions from two repos (see Dependancies) and can create the scaffold of folders for multiple participants/datasets at once.


For more in depth info on BIDS, please do visit the [website](https://github.com/bids-standard)

## Dependancies

Make sure that the following softwares are installed.
For instructions see the following links:
- [dcm2Bids](https://github.com/cbedetti/Dcm2Bids)
- [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix)


### Step 1
- Open the shell script `dicom2nii_BIDS_Step1.sh` in your preferred text editor.
- Change your desired BIDS output directory.

- Add the different groups of subjects and their names, and DICOM locations
- Run the `dicom2nii_BIDS_Step1.sh` in the terminal: `./sh dicom2nii_BIDS_Step1.sh`
- Go to your BIDS output directory and then to the `tmp_dcm2bids` folder
- Open the `json` files of the different conditions and get the `_SERIES DISCRIPTION_` ,
eg: `SeriesDescription: "Motion"` --> here the Series description is Motion.
- Create a new `json` file called `config.json` in the BIDS output directory. Add the conditions indicating the series description. Check the `config.json` for examples and the `config_json_template_different_modalities.json` for all possible modalities


### Step 2
- Open the shell script `dicom2nii_BIDS_Step2.sh` in your preferred text editor.
- Change your desired BIDS output directory, add the different groups of subjects and their names, and DICOM locations. __MAKE SURE IT MATCHS Step 1__

- repeat the blocks of code for each condition in your experiment (eg. anatomical, functional exp1, functional exp2, etc.)
- Make sure that the dicom location in each experimental condition is correct.
- Run the `dicom2nii_BIDS_Step2.sh` in the terminal: `./sh dicom2nii_BIDS_Step2.sh`
- move the produced subject folders in a folder called `raw` to kept as the untouched raw data.
- copy the contents of the raw folder in the `derivatives` folder
- Check the dataset whether its compatible with the [BIDS guidelines](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator)
- fix the errors until its compatible. :-)
